# 2018-12-12 GIT-Intro

In this folder you'll find the materials from the GIT-Intro session. The
slides are meade using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

To view the slides simply clone the repository or download the slides
directory and open index.html in your web browser. Alternatively if you
have `npm` installed in a terminal change to the slides directory and run
`npm install` and then `npm start`. For more information refer to the
documentation in the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
repository.
