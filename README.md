# Maptime Salzburg

*"Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much."* -- Helen Keller

We are a meetup in Salzburg about geo-related topics. Find more information on [maptime.io/salzburg/](http://maptime.io/salzburg/).

This repository serves as collection for all organizational notes:

## Organisation

This is where organisational stuff will be documented, such as:

- where and when meetings happen
- organisational suggestions from folks
- how to manage and update the github and wiki
- PR/outreach/getting people pumped
- improving accessibility of spaces, materials, etc.
- ...

## Topics

Here resources, presentations, folks to contact, tutorials, etc. will be documented for various topics.

A lot of this might be better done in a wiki. We'll see.

## Video Sample Cover

The videos start and end with a cover image. The template is called:  `video_sample_cover_intro_outro.odp`
