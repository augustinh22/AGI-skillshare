# maptime-Salzburg

This is a base for sharing knowledge, skills and resources related to geoinformatics, earth observation, geospatio-temporal-related programming, but more broadly academic and scientific research and communication. Hopefully as a base for organising workshops in an informal setting to share that sort of information, and get people in contact with folks who know some stuff and who are willing to skillshare even outside of these meetings in and around the city of Salzburg.
