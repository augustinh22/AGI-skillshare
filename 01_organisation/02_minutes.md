This is a running list of minutes from organisational meetings and decisions, with most recent on top, and older minutes on the bottom. The idea is that this will eventually be much more collaborative with many people participating, so here, things can be documented for all to read. People's abbreviations should be documented and kept up to date in the file ```./01_organsation/01_people.md```

- JM tested it this morning

We will still keep the Gmail account and use it as contact point, but no longer for communication about events.

### Trafficon and Space

## Minutes
### size of the room
  * the offered room by Trafficon only has space for maximum 15 people
  * JM: apparently meetings have a nicer atmosphere if the room is rather too small, because then it feels much fuller
  * we will stay in the space, but need to consider future options since we already have almost 10 interested people

### communication
  * mailing list will be created -- independent of different social media ecosystems and technologies
  * decided against a Slack channel, at the moment, since it is more difficult to archive and keep track of older discussions and interactions -- this can be revisited at a later date

### publicity
  * HA will create official Email account
  * we will probably have the website [maptime.io/Salzburg](maptime.io/Salzburg)
  * we already own the Twitter account [twitter.com/maptimesalzburg](https://twitter.com/maptimeSalzburg)
  * we could also create an account on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.technology/)
    * This is undecided
  * PS will create a logo
  * stick to word of mouth at the moment, other than creating a meetup event
  * in the future we should announce our meetup on various channels:
    * University: students and employees from all institutes (Z_GIS, Geography, Computer Science, Math, Geology, History, Political Science...)
    * companies
    * other meetups
    * OpenStreetMap Community
    * Makerspaces, Hackerspaces
    * government of Salzburg

### registration
   * JM will set us up on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) for the first meeting
   * registration via e-mail

### support, sponsoring
   * we could ask other companies for supporting our meetup in the future
   * perhaps talk to various organisations/companies in the GI-Cluster

### general program of the meetup
   * length: 90 minutes with a break in the middle
   * general topics to guide presentations (e.g. Open Data, Web programming, remote sensing, ...)
   * Starting with 3-4 presentations of 20 minutes -- open to also incorporating lightning talks, or different modi (e.g. hands-on workshops, shorter presentations...)
   * introduction of visitors at every meeting
     * name
     * affiliation
     * if new, how you heard about this meeting
   * language: English as default language, but open also to German presentations if preferred by presenters ... slides best in English, though
   * Tentatively set a meeting every month -- will ask the first round of attendees how often makes sense
   * set one moderator for the meeting to time-check and ask questions
   * publish list of planned presentations and presenters at least one week in advance

### documentation
   * take photos during meetup
   * upload slides
   * perhaps create a wiki
   * Perhaps create a maptime Salzburg github account for loading different hands-on repositories/workshops...
   * decided against filming presentations at the moment, but we will consider it for future events

### first topic
  * __OpenStreetMap!__ on Tuesday, 9.10.2018
  * also introduce the concept of maptime and how meetings should work in the future (including submitting topics)

# 2018-08-27

Decision was made to launch the first event on 2018-10-09 at the company Trafficon. A meeting for organizing the first event is scheduled for 2018-10-05.

# 2018-08-22

The Salzburg based company [Trafficon](https://www.trafficon.eu/) offered to support our meetup with providing a room and drinks.

# 2018-07-27

JM signed up to officially become a [Maptime](http://maptime.io/) chapter for Salzburg (*see* [this issue](https://github.com/maptime/maptime-admin/issues/245)). Perhaps it will make sense to have an official Maptime meeting every month, and then a second meeting that has to do with other topics (e.g. processing and analysis, EO, databases, other software...).

# 2018-06-27

HA and JM decide to create a repository to start collecting ideas. Discussions with other students and faculty at the University of Salzburg's Z_GIS about the possibility of regular, informal skillsharing is happening.

It seems that the first workshop will take place in autumn 2018.
