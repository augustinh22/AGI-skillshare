This ought to contain a schedule of planned meetings/workshops and general topics. It is meant to serve as an easy overview, with actual topic related content and discussion documented under specific topics, to allow a culmination of knowledge and skillsharing, and any organisational stuff documented independent of content in the minutes.

AH, JM, EW, NJ and PE are meeting will meet in a pizzeria in Salzburg. The preliminary topics will be:

* size of the room:
  * the offered room by Trafficon only has space for maximum 15 people
  * we should discuss if this is big enough or if it actually fits very well
  * apparently meetings have a nicer atmosphere if the room is rather too small, because then it feels much fuller
* communication:
  * mailing list or any chat
* publicity:
  * create official Email account
  * we will probably have the website [maptime.io/Salzburg](maptime.io/Salzburg)
  * we already own the Twitter account [twitter.com/maptimesalzburg](https://twitter.com/maptimeSalzburg)
  * we could also create an account on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.technology/)
  * logo: we need a logo, we can probably reuse the existing maptime logo

   * OpenStreetMap Community
   * Makerspaces, Hackerspaces
