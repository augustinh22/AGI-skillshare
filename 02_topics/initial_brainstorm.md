Here is a start to some brainstorming topics. We can organise these into different categories at another time. It makes sense to cover topics related to thesis writing, academic and scientific research, GI/EO/SDI curriculum (perhaps we ought to reference the BoK for organising topics), additional computer skills that make life easier, etc. while trying to serve a larger audience than just M.Sc students...
